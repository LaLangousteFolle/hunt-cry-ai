# Hunt kills tracker 
The goal of this little student project is to keep tracks of Hunt Showdown hunter's kills thanks to AI. This is a cool way lo learn how to use pytorch, jupyter and improve my knowledge about AI.

# Goals 🐾
- Difference between casual elimination and headshot one
- Detection of injure/death
- Detection of different weapons ammo type

|    Type    | Accuracy |
|------------|----------|
| Injured    |    WIP   |
| Dead       |    WIP   |
| Headshot   |    WIP   |
